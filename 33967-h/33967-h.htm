<div class="larger">
<p class="p2">Biological exploration of México and Central America has
revealed the presence of a diverse fauna, elements of which have
undergone speciation in separate areas within the relatively small
region. Some genera of amphibians, especially <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>
and <i>Hyla</i>, are represented by many species having small geographic
ranges in México and Central America. Most of the species of <i>Hyla</i>
inhabiting the lowlands have been known to science for many years, and
most of the novelties today are found in the less accessible highlands.
No fewer than 19 new species of hylid frogs have been discovered and
named from México and Central America in the past decade.</p>

<p>In the spring and summer of 1966 I studied hylid frogs in many parts
of southern México and Central America; the field work was designed to
obtain specimens and data that would resolve certain systematic
problems. To a certain extent the studies were successful, but in the
course of the work five previously unknown hylids were discovered; these
are named and described in this paper. The only species described herein
that I do not know in life is one of <i>Plectrohyla</i> that has been
represented in museum collections for several years but was not obtained
in my own field work.</p>

<p>In this paper I am presenting diagnoses, descriptions, and brief
comments on the relationships of five new species and one subspecies.
More exhaustive accounts will be included in a monograph, now in
preparation, on the Middle American hylids.</p>

<p>For use of comparative material used in the preparation of this
paper, I am indebted to Richard J. Baldauf, Texas Cooperative Wildlife
Collection (TCWC); Charles M. Bogert, American Museum of Natural History
(AMNH); James A. Peters, United States National Museum (USNM); Hobart M.
Smith, University of Illinois Museum of Natural History (UIMNH); Charles
F. Walker, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ); and Ernest
E. Williams, Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ). KU refers to the
University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. I am especially grateful
for help in obtaining specimens and data to Linda Trueb, who accompanied
me throughout México and Central America, where we were joined by John
D. Lynch in Costa Rica and Charles W. Myers in Panamá. Linda Trueb
offered helpful suggestions in the course of preparing the manuscript,
and David M. Dennis skillfully prepared the illustrations which more
accurately depict the frogs than my written descriptions; both of these
persons have my thanks for their contributions.</p>

<p>Ratibor Hartmann of Finca Santa Clara, Chiriquí, Panamá, made
possible our travels to the Río Changena on the Atlantic slopes of Bocas
del Toro. Field work in Costa Rica was facilitated by the Organization
of Tropical Studies through the courtesy of Stephen B. Preston and
Norman Scott. Rodolfo Hernandez Corzo of the Dirección General de la
Fauna Silvestre provided the necessary permits to collect in México. I
thank each of these persons for his helpfulness and cooperation.</p>

<p>Field work in México and Central America and the associated
laboratory studies on Middle American hylid frogs are supported by
grants from the National Science Foundation (GB-1441 and GB-5818). The
field work in Panamá was part of a survey of the herpetofauna of that
country carried out in cooperation with the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory
and supported by the National Institutes of Health (GM-12020).</p>

<p class="center p2"><b>Hyla xanthosticta</b> new species</p>

<p class="center">Plate 17</p>

<p><i>Holotype.</i>&mdash;Adult female, KU 103772, from the
south fork of the Río Las Vueltas on the south slope of Volcán Barba,
near the northwest base of Cerro Chompipe, Heredia Province, Costa Rica,
elevation 2100 meters; obtained on June 26, 1966, by John D. Lynch.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;A member of the <i>Hyla pictipes</i> group
(Starrett, 1966), characterized by having dorsum uniform green, canthal
stripe bronze-color, flanks and anterior and posterior surfaces of
thighs dark brown with bright yellow spots, throat and belly yellow, and
hands having only vestigial web.</p>

<p><i>Description of holotype.</i>&mdash;Female having a snout-vent
length of 29.3 mm.; tibia length 16.2 mm., 55.3 per cent of snout-vent
length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal

thin transverse dermal fold on heel; scalloped dermal fold along outer
edge of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle large, flat, elliptical,
visible from above; toes long, slender; length of toes from longest to
shortest, 1-2-5-3-4; discs small, barely wider than digits; subarticular
tubercles large, round, subconical; supernumerary tubercles few,
scattered on proximal segments of digits; toes about two-thirds webbed;
webbing extending from middle of penultimate phalanx of first toe to
middle of penultimate phalanx of second, from distal end of penultimate
phalanx of second to base of penultimate of third, from distal end of
penultimate phalanx of third to middle of antepenultimate of fourth to
middle of penultimate of fifth toe.</p>

<p>Anal opening directed posteroventrally at level of mid-thigh,
bordered below by large tubercles; anal sheath lacking. Skin smooth on
dorsum except for small scattered tubercles, granular on belly and
posteroventral surfaces of thighs. Tongue round, emarginate, barely free
behind. Prevomerine teeth 5-5, on large ovoid elevations at level of
posterior edges of small round choanae.</p>

<p>Color (in preservative): dark purplish brown above, brown on limbs;
first three fingers and first three toes creamy yellow; other digits
brown; flanks dark brown with white spots; anterior and posterior
surfaces of thighs and inner surfaces of shanks brown with cream-colored
spots. White stripes on edge of upper lip, ventrolateral edge of
forearm, outer edge of tarsus, and above anus. Chin and throat white;
belly and ventral surfaces of limbs cream-color.</p>

<p>Color (in life): dorsum green, palest on sides of head; dorsal
surfaces of thighs tan; canthal stripe bronze-tan (reddish copper at
night); flanks, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, and inner
surfaces of tarsi brown with bright yellow spots. Throat and belly pale
yellow; ventral surfaces of limbs dull, dark yellow; large, bright
yellow spot on anteroventral surface of thigh; bright yellow tubercles
on median part of ventral surface of thigh. Anal area dark brown with
white stripe above and yellow stripe below; white stripe on outer edge
of forearm, outer edge of tarsus, and edge of upper lip. Iris gold-color
with fine black reticulations and faint reddish suffusion medially;
palpebral membrane clear.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;<i>Hyla xanthosticta</i> is a member of the
<i>Hyla pictipes</i> group that contains <i>debilis</i>,
<i>pictipes</i>, <i>rivularis</i>, and <i>tica</i>. From all of these,
<i>xanthosticta</i> differs by having large yellow spots on the flanks
and thighs, a white labial stripe, and a large yellow spot on the
proximal ventral surface of each thigh. Females of <i>Hyla pictipes</i>
have small creamy yellow spots on the flanks and thighs but have dark
spots on the venter; furthermore, <i>pictipes</i> lacks white stripes on
the upper lip and above the anus, lacks a canthal stripe, and has larger
discs and less webbing on the hand. <i>Hyla tica</i> differs from
<i>xanthosticta</i> by having white mottling on the flanks, dark
transverse bands on the limbs, and larger discs, and lacks yellow spots
on the thighs, and white stripes on the upper lip, limbs, and above the
anus. <i>Hyla rivularis</i> is notably different in having a tan dorsum
and creamy yellow venter with black flecks; moreover, <i>rivularis</i>
lacks spots on the flanks and thighs and white stripes on the upper lip,
limbs, and above the anus. Of all of the species in the <i>pictipes</i>
group, <i>xanthosticta</i> most closely resembles <i>debilis</i>. This
species has a dull green dorsum, usually flecked with brown or black,
and a creamy white venter. The flanks of <i>debilis</i> are creamy white
with small brown flecks, and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the
thighs are bright yellow. <i>Hyla debilis</i> has a dull tan canthal
stripe and white spots on the upper lip; the webbing on the hand is
slightly more extensive, and the discs are slightly larger, in
<i>debilis</i> than in <i>xanthosticta</i>.</p>

<p>The presence of the large yellow spots on the flanks and thighs in
combination with the uniformly green dorsum and yellow venter
immediately distinguishes <i>Hyla xanthosticta</i> from all other known
species of Middle American hylids.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The only known specimen of <i>Hyla
xanthosticta</i> was perched at night on a leaf about one meter above the
ground. The frog was found in humid upper montane forest characterized by
large oaks supporting many bromeliads and heavy growths of mosses. Two
other members of the <i>Hyla pictipes</i> group&mdash;<i>pictipes</i> and
<i>rivularis</i>&mdash;were abundant along a stream in the oak
forest.</p>

<p>The specific name is derived from the Greek <i>xanthos</i> meaning
yellow and the Greek <i>stiktos</i> meaning spotted, and alludes to the
diagnostic yellow spots on the flanks and thighs.</p>

<p>Anal opening directed posteriorly at level of upper surfaces of
thighs, bordered below by vertical flesh folds; anal sheath absent. Skin
of belly, ventral surfaces of arms, and proximal posteroventral surfaces
of thighs granular, elsewhere smooth. Tongue ovoid, about twice as long
as wide, shallowly notched posteriorly, barely free behind. Prevomerine
teeth 5-6, situated on transverse ridges between posterior borders of
small round choanae. Vocal slit extending from midlateral edge of tongue
to angle of jaw.</p>

<p>Color (in preservative): dorsum grayish tan with large brown blotch
extending from eyelids to middle of back, limbs marked with brown
transverse bars, 2 on each forearm, 3 on each thigh, shank, and foot.
Flanks dark gray with white spots; groin, anterior and posterior
surfaces of thighs, ventral surfaces of shanks, and inner edges of feet
orange-tan; anal region dark brown, bordered above by white stripe;
belly and chin creamy white, latter with grayish brown flecks.</p>

<p>Color (in life): dorsum yellowish tan with olive-brown markings by
night and uniform pale yellowish tan by day; axilla, inner surface of
elbow, groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, ventral
surfaces of thighs and shanks, inner surfaces of feet, and dorsal
surfaces of first three toes tomato red; flanks dark blue with yellow
spots and reticulations. Throat, chest, and anterior part of belly
creamy white; posterior part of belly orange, becoming red in extreme
posterior region; throat flecked with brown; iris pale bronze with black
reticulations; palpebral membrane clear above, yellowish tan below;
nuptial excrescenses dark brown.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;The discussion of variation is based on the
type series plus 31 specimens (KU 101781-811) from the Río Claro near
its junction with the Río Changena, at an elevation of 910 meters.
Females are slightly larger than males, but do not differ significantly
in proportions (Table 1). All specimens have the diagnostic red legs and
blue flanks with yellow spots or mottling, but the dorsal pattern is
highly variable. In most individuals the dark markings on the dorsum are
a solid color, but in some the borders of the marks are dark, and the
interior of each mark is nearly the same color as the rest of the
dorsum. A triangular dark mark with the anterolateral corners on the
eyelids is present in all specimens. In some individuals the posteriorly
directed apex of this triangular mark is connected to the apex of
another triangular mark on the back; in other individuals the marks are
narrowly separated, whereas in a few specimens the marks are broadly
connected. A dark blotch usually is present on the posterior end of the
body. One specimen (KU 101771) has many small white spots on the dorsum.
The white stripe above the anus is invariably present, and the
transverse bars on the limbs are present in all specimens, although they
are indistinct in some individuals. The pattern on the flanks varies
from three or four large spots to many (30-44) small spots. All males
have dark flecks or reticulations on the throat; in some individuals the
chest and belly are heavily flecked. Although the amount of flecking is
much less in most females, one individual is as heavily flecked on the
throat and belly as any male.</p>

<p>The change in coloration in this frog is noteworthy. The following
description of metachrosis in seven specimens from the Río Claro
illustrates the change. At night the frogs were yellowish tan above with
slightly darker dorsal markings. The axilla, groin, anterior and
posterior surfaces of the thighs, ventral surfaces of the hind limbs,
and webbing on the hands and feet were tomato red. By day, some
individuals became creamy yellow, others ashy white, and others grayish
tan. The flanks were dark blue with yellow spots.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;The population of frogs described here
closely resembles <i>Hyla pseudopuma</i> Günther in the highlands of
Costa Rica. Both have the same kind of, and variation in, dorsal
markings; conical, pigmented supernumerary tubercles on the toes;
bilobate vocal sac; and large prepollex bearing horny nuptial spinules.
Although at present no evidence for intergradation exists, the
population described here is considered to be a subspecies of <i>Hyla
pseudopuma</i>.</p>

<p>The two subspecies exhibit few differences in size and proportions,
except that the tympanum is larger in <i>pseudopuma</i> (Table 1).
<i>Hyla p. pseudopuma</i> has dark brown or yellowish tan thighs and
brown flanks with a few creamy white spots; the groin in some specimens
is pale blue. The red color on the limbs characteristic of
<i>infucata</i> is lacking in <i>pseudopuma</i>, which also lacks the
white stripe above the anus characteristic of <i>infucata</i>. The only
noticeable morphological difference between the subspecies, except in
the size of the tympanum, is the shape of the snout. In <i>infucata</i>
the snout is bluntly rounded in lateral profile and truncate in dorsal
profile, whereas in <i>pseudopuma</i> the snout is more acutely rounded
in lateral profile and acuminate in dorsal profile (Fig. 1). This
external difference is correlated with the nature of the underlying
premaxillaries. In <i>infucata</i> the premaxillaries lie in a
transverse plane and have short, nearly vertical alary processes,
whereas in <i>pseudopuma</i> the premaxillaries lie at a slight angle
and have longer alary processes that are inclined posteriorly.</p>

 of the heads of <i>Hyla pseudopuma pseudopuma</i> (left, KU 64884)<br />
 and  <i>H. p. infucata</i> (right, KU 101784). × 4.</p>
</div>

<p>The only other frog in Central America having red webs and anterior
and posterior surfaces of the thighs is <i>Hyla loquax</i>, which has a
broad head, extensive axillary membrane, single median vocal sac, and
uniformly creamy yellow flanks; furthermore, <i>loquax</i> lacks
conical, pigmented supernumerary tubercles on the toes and a large
prepollex with horny nuptial spinules. <i>Hyla rufitela</i> has red
webbing, but in no other diagnostic feature resembles <i>infucata</i>,
for <i>rufitela</i> is green above, white below, and has angular
prevomerine dentigerous ridges.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Most specimens of <i>Hyla pseudopuma
infucata</i> were found on bushes and low trees at night. Three males
and one clasping pair were on the ground. The habitat is humid lower
montane forest where the amount of rainfall is high. Although no
breeding was observed nor calls heard, it is presumed that this
subspecies breeds in shallow, temporary pools, like those utilized by
the nominate subspecies.</p>

<p>The two localities where <i>Hyla pseudopuma infucata</i> is known are
in the maze of ridges north of Cerro Pando on the Panamanian-Costa Rican
border. The Río Claro is a tributary of the Río Changena, in turn a
tributary of the Río Changuinola, which receives many streams and rivers
draining the northern slopes of the highlands in Bocas del Toro Province
before flowing into the Caribbean. We reached the Río Claro and Río
Changena by walking from Finca Santa Clara on the Pacific slopes, over
the continental divide, and down the north slope of Cerro Pando.</p>

<p>The subspecific name is derived from the Latin <i>infucatus</i>,
meaning painted, in allusion to the red colors on the limbs and
webs.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;A small yellowish tan <i>Hyla</i>
characterized by tympanum concealed, anal opening not bordered below by
large tubercles, brown bands on shanks, and dark flecks on roof of mouth
anteriorly.</p>

<p><i>Description of holotype.</i>&mdash;Adult male having snout-vent
length of 27.3 mm.; tibia length 13.7 mm., 50.2 per cent of snout-vent
length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal
tubercle to tip of longest toe) 11.7 mm., 42.9 per cent of snout-vent

<p>Axillary membrane absent; forearms moderately slender, having
indistinct tuberculate fold on ventrolateral edge, lacking distinct
transverse fold on wrist; fingers short; length of fingers from shortest
to longest, 1-4-2-3, fourth nearly as long as second; discs small, about
half again as wide as digits; subarticular tubercules large, round,
flattened, distal ones on third and fourth fingers bifid; supernumerary
tubercles large, round, present only on proximal segments; prepollex
barely enlarged, lacking nuptial excrecence. Web lacking between first
and second fingers, extending from base of penultimate phalanx of second

antepenultimate phalanx of third to distal end of antepenultimate of
fourth finger. Heels overlap by about one-fifth length of shank when
hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extending to middle of
eye, tarsal fold present, extending full length of tarsus; inner
metatarsal tubercle flat, ovoid, partly visible from above; outer
metatarsal tubercle absent; toes short; length of toes from shortest to
longest, 1-2-3-5-4; discs small, about two-thirds width of those on

three-fourth webbed; web extending from base of disc of first to middle
of penultimate phalanx of second, from base of disc of second to middle
of penultimate phalanx of third, from base of disc of third to base of
penultimate phalanx of fourth and to base of disc of fifth toe.</p>

<p>Anal opening directed posteriorly at level of dorsal surfaces of
thighs, bordered below by vertical dermal folds and few small tubercles;
anal sheath absent. Skin heavily granular on throat, chest, belly and
ventral surfaces of thighs, smooth elsewhere. Tongue cordiform, deeply
notched posteriorly, barely free behind. Prevomerine teeth 3-4, situated
on short elevations between small round choanae; vocal slits absent.</p>

<p>Color (in preservative): pale tan above with dark brown mark in
occipital region and large irregular brown mark extending from scapular
region to sacral region; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs and
flanks lacking pigment; dorsal surfaces of arms, shanks, and feet tan
with brown transverse bars (two on each forearm, two on left shank, one
on right shank, and one on each foot); entire dorsal surfaces, except
hands and first four toes, peppered with black; venter creamy white;
roof of mouth between, and anterior to, choanae speckled with minute
black flecks.</p>

<p>Color (in life): yellowish tan above with reddish brown flecks (later
changed to pale brown with dull olive-green interorbital bar, blotch on
back, and flecks on dorsum); hands, feet, and anterior and posterior
surfaces of thighs dull yellow; belly white; creamy white stripes on
outer edge of forearm, foot, and above anus; iris pale silver-bronze.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;Three adult males (including holotype) have
snout-vent lengths of 25.2-27.3 (mean 26.5) mm., and two females have
28.6 and 31.6 (mean 30.1) mm. One juvenile has a snout-vent length of
21.5 mm. No significant variation occurs in the proportions. Males have
6-8, and females have 8 and 9, prevomerine teeth. The tympanum is
completely concealed in all specimens.</p>

<p>All specimens have distinct transverse bars on the limbs; the number
of bars on the shank varies from one to four. Two individuals are dark
brown dorsally; in these the small black flecks either are not visible
or are absent; flecks are present on the dorsal surfaces of four
specimens that are tan or pale brown above with darker brown irregular
markings.</p>

<p>The coloration in life consisted of olive-green or olive-brown
markings on the body and olive-green or brown bars on the limbs. The
dorsal ground color was yellowish tan or pale brown in all
individuals.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;<i>Hyla pellita</i> differs from all known
Middle American <i>Hyla</i>, except <i>mixe</i>, <i>mixomaculata</i>,
<i>nubicola</i>, and <i>pinorum</i>, by having a concealed tympanum. The
first three of these differ from <i>pellita</i> in greater size and by
having many bands on the hind limbs. Superficially <i>H. pellita</i>
resembles <i>Hyla pinorum</i>, which likewise has a tan dorsum
with irregular markings and limbs with transverse bars. <i>Hyla
pinorum</i> differs from <i>pellita</i> by having a proportionately
larger head, no transverse bands on the thighs, and large tubercles
below the anus. Furthermore, in <i>pinorum</i> the quadratojugal
articulates with the maxillary, whereas in <i>pellita</i> the
quadratojugal is reduced to a small spur and does not articulate with
the maxillary.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;All individuals were found on low vegetation
along streams in cloud forest at night. No specimens were found when the
type locality was revisited in August, 1966.</p>

<p>Duellman (1960) placed <i>Hyla pinorum</i> Taylor in the synonymy of
<i>Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei</i> Ahl. At that time only the holotype,
a female, of <i>H. pinorum</i> was known. In 1964 Kraig Adler and I
independently collected frogs and associated tadpoles in Guerrero that
subsequently proved to be <i>Hyla pinorum</i> and provided evidence that
<i>Hyla pinorum</i> is not conspecific with <i>Ptychohyla
leonhardschultzei</i>.</p>

<p>The specific name <i>pellita</i> is Latin, meaning covered with skin,
and is here used in reference to the complete concealment of the
tympanum beneath the skin.</p>

one-third of tympanum, to insertion of arm; tympanum barely distinct,
its diameter 2.2 mm., 46.8 per cent that of eye, separated from eye by
distance equal to half again diameter of tympanum.</p>

<p>Axillary membrane absent; thoracic fold weak; arms moderately robust;
fold on wrist heavy; fingers long, slender; length of fingers from
shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs large, that on third finger as large
as tympanum; subarticular tubercles moderately small, round, none bifid;
supernumerary tubercles small, some barely distinguishable, in single
row on proximal segment of each digit; prepollex greatly enlarged, flat
ventrally, bearing nuptial excrescence composed of minute horny
spinules; webbing between first two fingers vestigial; web connecting
other fingers at bases of penultimate phalanges of second and fourth,
and base of antepenultimate phalanx of third fingers. Heels overlap by
about one-third length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal
articulation extends to posterior edge of orbit; transverse dermal fold
on heel; tarsal fold thin, distinct, extending length of tarsus; inner
metatarsal tubercle large, elongate, flat, visible from above; outer
metatarsal tubercle absent; toes moderately long, slender; length of
toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4; discs slightly smaller than
those on fingers; subarticular tubercles moderately small, round;
supernumerary tubercles small, in single row on proximal segment of each
digit; toes about two-thirds webbed; webbing extends from middle of
penultimate phalanx of first toe to base of penultimate phalanx of
second, from middle of penultimate of second to middle of
antepenultimate of third, from middle of penultimate of third to middle
of antepenultimate of fourth to middle of penultimate phalanx of fifth
toe.</p>

<p>Anal opening directed posteriorly at level of mid-thigh; anal sheath
short. Skin granular on chin, belly, and posteroventral surfaces of
thighs, smooth elsewhere. Tongue broadly cordiform, notched posteriorly,
barely free behind. Prevomerine teeth 4-4, situated on posteromedially
inclined elevations between small ovoid choanae. Vocal slits absent.</p>

<p>Color (in preservative): dull grayish brown above with small,
irregularly-shaped black spots on head, back, and limbs; flanks gray
mottled with creamy tan; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs tan;
belly dull creamy tan; throat marked with gray blotches; anal region and
posterodorsal surfaces of thighs marked with small white spots.</p>

<p>Color (in life): dorsum pale green with black spots and
reticulations; flanks mottled dark brown and creamy white; outer edges
of feet silvery white with brown spots; anterior and posterior surfaces
of thighs dull brown; webbing and first three toes dull yellowish tan;
belly creamy gray; throat silvery white, mottled with gray; iris dull
bronze-color with black reticulations; palpebral membrane clear.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;The snout-vent length in seven adult males is
47.2-50.0 mm., and in five females, 45.1-52.5 mm. In neither sex do the
average proportions differ noticeably from those of the holotype, except
that the tympanum is relatively larger in females. The ratio of the
diameter of the tympanum to that of the eye is 0.363-0.468 (mean 0.438)
in males and 0.500-0.545 (mean 0.516) in females. The average number of
prevomerine teeth in males is 7.9, in females 8.4.</p>

<p>In life dorsal coloration varied from pale green to olive-green with
darker green or black flecks or reticulations, or pinkish tan to brown
with dark brown flecks or reticulations. Some preserved specimens have
relatively few dark flecks, whereas in most specimens the dorsum is
heavily marked. All specimens have some white markings above the anus
and on the posterodorsal surfaces of the thighs, but in some individuals
the white flecks are expanded and interconnected forming an irregular
white line.</p>

<p>Juveniles have a notably different coloration in life. The dorsum is
uniform pale green; the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs,
fingers, first three toes, and webbing are deep yellow. The anal stripe
is creamy white, and the flanks are pale gray with black flecks. The
upper lip, supratympanic fold, and canthal stripe are a bronze color.
The belly is pale yellow with a silvery cast on the throat. Juveniles
having snout-vent lengths from 24.5 to 36.6 mm. are so colored in life,
and uniform dark bluish gray dorsally in preservative.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;The absence of a quadratojugal and the
presence of a greatly enlarged, non-projecting prepollex place <i>Hyla
siopela</i> in the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group (see Duellman, 1964, and
Adler, 1965). The presence of a rostral keel separates <i>Hyla
siopela</i> from other members of the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group, which
is composed of two species having long anal sheaths (<i>bistincta</i> and
<i>pentheter</i>), two small species having axillary membranes and
lacking nuptial excrescences in breeding males (<i>charadricola</i> and
<i>chryses</i>), and three species (<i>crassa</i>, <i>pachyderma</i>, and
<i>robertsorum</i>) having short heads, round snouts, short anal sheaths,
and nuptial excrescences in breeding males. <i>Hyla siopela</i> differs
from the last three species in the shape of the snout and from each in
certain structural features; <i>H. crassa</i> has fully webbed feet;
<i>H. pachyderma</i> has large nuptial spines, and <i>H. robertsorum</i>
has more webbing and a shorter tarsal fold. Furthermore, the venter in
<i>H. robertsorum</i> is brown with creamy white flecks.</p>

<p>In structure and coloration <i>H. arborescandens</i> resembles
<i>siopela</i>, but the former is smaller, and males of
<i>arborescandens</i> have vocal slits.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This description brings to eight the number of
species now recognized in the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group. <i>Hyla
siopela</i> is most closely related to <i>Hyla robertsorum</i> from the
high mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northern Puebla and
eastern Hidalgo. Possibly the four species now recognized in the
<i>crassa</i> subgroup (<i>crassa</i>, <i>pachyderma</i>,
<i>robertsorum</i>, and <i>siopela</i>) are only subspecies of a single
species, but differences in the amount of webbing in <i>crassa</i> and
the nature of the nuptial excrescenses in <i>pachyderma</i> indicate
that they are distinct species.</p>

<p>The type locality of <i>Hyla siopela</i> is a small stream cascading
down the western slope of Cofre de Perote; the lower reaches of the
stream can be reached by a dirt road leading east from the village of
Perote for about 2 kilometers to a small park. The frogs were found in
the stream at elevations of 50 to 100 meters higher than the park. The
stream flows through a ravine supporting open, dry pine forest. Although
the stream was searched thoroughly in February, 1966, no frogs were
found. In July, 1966, adults and juveniles were found in crevices and
under overhanging rocks behind small cascades and waterfalls by day and
sitting on rocks and branches in the spray of cascades at night.</p>

<p>The specific name <i>siopela</i> is derived from the Greek
<i>siopelos</i>, meaning silent, and alludes to the absence of a voice
in this species.</p>

of prevomerine teeth varies from 13 to 18 (mean, 15) in five adult males
and from 10 to 12 (mean 11) in two females.</p>

<p>The testes in all adult males are granular, ovoid in shape, and
greatly enlarged. The lengths of the left testis in each of the five
males are 11.0 to 23.5 (mean 14.6) mm.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;On the basis of external appearance and
certain cranial characters (large frontoparietal fontanelle, broad
sphenethmoid, large nasals broadly separated medially having thin
lateral processes articulating with the palatines, short squamosal not
articulating with the maxillary, and quadratojugal present and
articulating with the maxillary), <i>Hyla altipotens</i> can be
associated with the <i>Hyla taeniopus</i> group (Duellman, 1965, Lynch
and Smith, 1966). <i>Hyla altipotens</i> can be distinguished from all
of the other members of the group by its narrow head, pointed snout in
both sexes, and uniformly yellow throat and belly.</p>

<p>Small brown individuals of <i>Hyla altipotens</i> superficially
resemble adult <i>Hyla pinorum</i>. The latter species has a covered
tympanum, less webbing on the hands, and a short, blunt snout.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This stream-breeding frog is like <i>Hyla
taeniopus</i> in having greatly enlarged testes, which possibly through
the production of vast quantities of sperm are an adaptation for
successful breeding in torrential streams (Duellman, 1965:164).</p>

<p>All individuals were found in trees and bushes near streams in cloud
forest at night in February. The type locality is the same as that of
<i>Hyla pentheter</i> and <i>Hyla thorectes</i>, discovered by Kraig
Adler in June, 1964. Our field work there in February, 1966, resulted in
finding <i>Hyla altipotens</i>, <i>H. pellita</i>, and <i>Ptychohyla
leonhardschultzei</i>, but no individuals of the species found by Adler.
A visit to the same locality in August, 1966, revealed no individuals of
either <i>H. altipotens</i> or <i>pellita</i>; instead <i>pentheter</i>
and <i>thorectes</i> were found along the stream.</p>

<p>Duellman (1965:166) listed a specimen (TCWC 16184) of <i>Hyla
chaneque</i> from Los Fustes, 3 kilometers east of San Sebastian,
Oaxaca. Rëexamination of this specimen reveals that it is <i>Hyla
altipotens</i>. The frog was obtained by Dilford Carter on April 29,
1960; it was under a rock at the edge of a stream in an oak-pine-cypress
association at an elevation of 1800 meters.</p>

<p>The specific name <i>altipotens</i> is Latin, meaning mighty, here
used in allusion to the supposed potentiality of fertilization by the
production of vast quantities of sperm in the large testes.</p>

</div>

<p>Axillary membrane absent; arms robust, forearm not noticeably heavier
than upper arm; distinct transverse fold on wrist. Fingers long,
moderately slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3;
discs moderately large, that on third finger larger than tympanum;
webbing vestigial; subarticular tubercles small, conical; terminal
tubercle on fourth finger somewhat flattened; supernumerary tubercles
small, in one row on proximal segment of fourth finger and in two rows
on proximal segments of other fingers; prepollex greatly enlarged,
barely bifurcate; spines not protruding through skin; distal spine much
longer than proximal one (Fig. 2). Heels overlap by about one-third
length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation
extends slightly beyond snout; heavy transverse dermal fold on heel;
inner tarsal fold heavy, extending full length of tarsus; outer tarsal
fold absent; inner metatarsal tubercle high, elliptical, visible from
above, outer metatarsal tubercle absent. Toes long, slender; length of
toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-5-3-4; fifth toe nearly as long as
third; discs small; subarticular tubercles small, round; supernumerary
tubercles small, in single row on proximal segment of each digit; toes
about three-fourths webbed; webbing extending from base of disc of first
toe to base of penultimate phalanx of third, from base of disc of third
to base of penultimate phalanx of fourth to base of disc of fifth
toe.</p>

<p>Anal opening directed posteroventrally at level of mid-thigh; anal
sheath long with membranous connection to posterior surfaces of thighs.
Skin on dorsal surfaces finely tuberculate; that on throat, chest,
belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular, that on ventral surfaces
of arms and shanks smooth. Tongue nearly round, free posteriorly for
about one-fourth its length, barely notched behind. Upper jaw shallowly
notched medially. Maxillary-premaxillary teeth 38-35; prevomerine teeth
5-5, situated on small elliptical elevations between quadrangular
choanae; vocal slits absent.</p>

<p>Color (in preservative): uniform dull brown above and creamy yellow
below; flanks brown with creamy yellow mottling and dark brown spots in
groin; anterior surfaces of thighs creamy yellow with two broad,
vertical, dark brown bars proximally and two narrower, dull brown bars
distally; posterior surfaces of thighs brown with dark brown vertical
bars, interspaces cream-colored or brown. Ventral surfaces of shanks
creamy yellow with bold brown reticulations.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;The paratypes are smaller, having snout-vent
lengths of 48.3 and 41.8 mm. In these specimens the ratio of the length
of the tibia to the snout-vent length is 55.9 and 57.9 per cent, and the
ratio of the diameter of the tympanum to the diameter of the eye is 47.3
and 43.6 per cent, respectively. Both specimens have 4-4 prevomerine
teeth; one specimen has 37-36, and the other has 40-37,
maxillary-premaxillary teeth. In these small specimens the supratympanic
fold is thin, and the arms are not so robust as in the holotype. In one
specimen (KU 58873) the tongue is not notched posteriorly. The terminal
subarticular tubercle on each fourth finger is broad and flattened in
UIMNH 40837, but conical in KU 58873. Both specimens have bold
creamy-yellow and dark brown mottling on the flanks and dark brown
reticulations on the ventral surfaces of the shanks. There are two dark
brown vertical bars on the anterior and posterior surfaces of each thigh
in KU 58873 and three bars on each surface in UIMNH 40837.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;<i>Plectrohyla hartwegi</i> differs from
all known species in the genus by having boldly mottled flanks, dark
reticulations on the ventral surfaces of the shanks, and dark vertical
bars on the shanks. In all of the other species the anterior and
posterior surfaces of the thighs are unmarked, and the flanks are either
plain or marked with small spots or flecks. Structurally, <i>P.
hartwegi</i> belongs in the <i>guatemalensis</i> group of the genus,
containing <i>avia</i>, <i>glandulosa</i>, <i>guatemalensis</i>, and
<i>pycnochila</i>. The species in this group lack vocal slits and have
either large, rectangular, or bifid prepollices. <i>Plectrohyla
hartwegi</i> differs from all of these species, except
<i>pycnochila</i>, by having a tuberculate, instead of a smooth, dorsum,
and <i>hartwegi</i> differs from <i>pycnochila</i> by having a bifid,
instead of a rectangular, prepollex.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The known distribution of <i>Plectrohyla
hartwegi</i> includes three localities at elevations of 1000 to 2050
meters in the Sierra Madre of Chiapas and extreme eastern Oaxaca. The
specimen from Parajé El Triunfo was found in a rocky stream in cloud
forest at an elevation of 2050 meters. One <i>Plectrohyla sagorum</i>
was obtained from the same stream.</p>

<p>Eizi Matuda sent the holotype to the late Dr. Norman Hartweg, who
recognized that the specimen was unique but was reluctant to name the
species on the basis of a single specimen. Now that two additional
specimens are available, it seems appropriate to associate Hartweg's
name with this new species of <i>Plectrohyla</i>, a genus that Hartweg
first adequately defined.</p>
